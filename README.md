# ServerBoard
🔨 Work in progress 📏
⚠️ Do not use in a production environment. Only tested on Ubuntu 20.04. Possible bugs. ⚠️

ServerBoard is my all-in-one server management dashboard. Currently, it supports running containers via docker-compose, monitoring containers, removing containers, and managing server power.
